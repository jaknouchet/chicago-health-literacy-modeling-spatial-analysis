# Impact of Socioeconomic Determinants on Access to Health Information in Chicago

This project investigates the relationship between socioeconomic, demographic, and spatial determinants and the level of health literacy among residents of Chicago. Using advanced spatial analysis and econometric modeling (OLS, SAR, SLX, SEM, SDM models), the main objectives are to:

   - Model spatial disparities in health literacy across Chicago neighborhoods;

   - Identify key factors (e.g., poverty, unemployment, crime, housing conditions, access to transportation) that influence the health literacy index (HealthLit);

   - Provide policy recommendations to improve access to health information and healthcare in the most vulnerable areas.

The data are sourced from the GeoDa Data & Lab platform [https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/Chi-SDOH/], the U.S. Census Bureau, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP), and the Chicago Department of Public Health, ensuring comprehensive coverage of social determinants and health outcomes.

This study contributes to discussions around spatial justice and the reduction of health inequalities, emphasizing the role of geography in shaping access to health-related knowledge and services.
